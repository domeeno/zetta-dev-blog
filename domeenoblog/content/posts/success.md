This is a reminder on achievements. To my fellow engineers, a small list that guarantees your success, regardless of the technology you use.

## You are persistent

Find yourself putting in the effort, remember your own "Why?". Make this part of your routine.

- Wake up,
- Make the bed, hydrate, brush,
- Complete your most pressing errands,
- Design, Code and keep learning.

You have obligations - job, university, family. But you also have obligations towards your future self. If you don't code regularly, and really find the time for it, progress will also not find time for you. So don't wait or ignore it.

The persistence is your key to success, and the key is in your hand.

## Build small.

Waiting until you "learn enough" is a lifelong wait. You learn the most by doing. Set small achievements, modularize your app or keep them small.

You can quickly build a solid portfolio of knowledge and mileage if you keep your projects short or cut them into small achievable meaningful tasks. This will challenge your design thinking and leadership skills that it takes to manage a project.

Build confidence, persistent practice will make retaining information easier and will build habits of a great software engineer. Code daily and showcase what you build.

## Start a coding blog

Having the dedication to communicate your knowledge is commendable and invaluable.

You practice learning and teaching new technologies and practices. Doing it will give you the practice and build skill in conveing ideas, also build the confidence to make hard to access information easy, and build the capability to explain complex topics in simple terms.

## Collab on Open Source

As soon as you start the better. Open Source is the gateway to an encyclopedia to a variety of technologies and different implementations you certainly would benefit from, just from glancing.

Start early, even as a junior or intern. Take the technology you want to learn or work with. Read documentations on existing projects on Github, see the open issues and pick the ones you're comfortable with. Skimming through the code you will find ways of writing and architecting repositories that are completely different from your work, or find new optimised ways of doing something, that you can take and apply it to your own work.
