Hi, I'm a software engineer just starting on my path, currently as I'm writing this I haven't even finished my first university cycle, but I'm almost there. I'm excited to start this "Blog" and write about - pretty much anything that makes me feel inspired. I would like to start this out with a quote:

A lot of my inspiration to write comes from the frustrations that I have with a language, framework or frustrations that I generally have as a developer. I do have a lot of them. But we always manage to overcome them, don't we?

Maybe, just maybe, I could help someone out there with their frustrations that they had being in the same position as I was, maybe it's you? Hi, welcome, have a seat, grab a tea. I feel extremely lucky to have you here, whatever brought you here in the first place, I'm happy you are here. My name is Dominic, currently a 22 years old student and here's a bit I can share with you as an appreciation for you being here.

Although I'm just a student I already had professional experience in the field. I was lucky to find a job that really complimented what I want to do. I was building things from scratch and therefore had experience with many languages and frameworks.

I worked with javascript, java, python, elixir, kotlin and used React, Spring, Django, Phoenix, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, GraphQL to name a few. 

I'm proud of it, to experience such a range of great tools. I quickly began to see how little matters the language, the framework. I love problem solving. That's me, I want to solve problems and do it using different tools and approaches. 

Doing this, I've encountered moments where I was just lost, when I was not finding the right documentation, or the documentation was hard for me to understand so I had to go through trial and errors and come up with a work-a-round, or find the solution which wasn't documented anywhere but it existed right there,  so I was basically finding it the hard way. 

And one thing that I also love besides problem solving is to share what I know with others and always help when asked for advice. 

I will keep this blog for you. You, who may need a solution, a case documentation to a particular problem, or you who is just into reading articles and dev rants.
