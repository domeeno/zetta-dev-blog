Hi there, How are you doing? Oh, fantastic? you should keep it up, you're doing great!

Glad you're here, I can tell you something about myself and why I began blogging. I'm a software developer, probably just like you, or maybe not, but for one I'm certain - We learn our whole life and just like you I'm learning new things everywhere I turn, intentionally or unintentionally.

You can take useful information from right here. I like to share the challenges I faced and how I overcome them, maybe it will inspire you and help you in your own career, and path to becoming who you want to be. Fortunately the answers aren't always obvious and clear, but that's the beauty of life, you have to turn for some help discovering new perspectives and ways to solve and overcome. I sure did, more than I care to admit, and I want to do my part and give back to the community I've been a part of for the last few years.

## - My Why

A lot of my inspiration to write will be drawn from the frustrations that I have maybe with a programming language, or maybe with a framework or frustrations that I generally have as a developer or as a citizen of this planet. I want to share them, maybe it will help someone just like countless others helped me throughout my life.

## - About the blog

I will try my best to write as consistenly as I can, being a student, a software developer and a friend to my loved ones. 

The blog's main focus will be developer oriented. I will write about languages, projects that I make, I want to focus on System Design, System Architecture, little useful hacks for developers or something interesting that I learned and feeling like sharing it and talking about it. Here's some programming languages that I like or want to use more of:
- Kotlin
- Elixir
- Python
- C++

I really-really want to make using the above:
- a beautiful distributed web app
- a game engine
- a game
- more distributed web apps

...and much more!

Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, Kafka, SQL, NoSQL you name it. I will be using <a href="https://domeeno.github.io/tags/" target="_blank">tags</a> so you can easily find my posts by topic.
